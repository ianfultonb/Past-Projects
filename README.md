# Past-Projects

These projects were each created in RMarkdown, and each refer to the Special Olympics Vermont annual fundraiser. Some are quick-hitters (Edmunds, Union Mutual)
for people that wanted to know their history and had little analysis background, and the other two include one predictive analysis, and one post-event analysis.
There is more analysis that could have been completed in these projects for a deeper understanding of the events -- the purpose of them was to provide quick visuals
and takeaways in a small amount of time.
