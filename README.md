# Past-Projects

These projects were each created in RMarkdown, and each refer to the Special Olympics Vermont annual fundraiser, the Penguin Plunge.
Some are quick-hitters (Edmunds, Union Mutual) for people that wanted to know their history and had little analysis background, and the other two include one predictive analysis, and one retrospective analysis. There is more in-depth work that could have been completed in these projects for a deeper understanding of the events -- the purpose of them was to provide quick visuals and takeaways in a small amount of time.
